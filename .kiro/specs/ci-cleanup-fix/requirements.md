# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions cleanup workflow is failing because it cannot fetch the `gh-pages` branch. This occurs when the `gh-pages` branch doesn't exist yet or when there are Git configuration issues in the CI environment. The cleanup workflow is designed to remove old preview deployments for closed pull requests, but it's currently failing with a Git fetch error.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI cleanup workflow to handle missing gh-pages branch gracefully, so that the workflow doesn't fail when the branch doesn't exist yet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup workflow runs AND the gh-pages branch doesn't exist THEN the workflow SHALL skip cleanup operations gracefully
2. WHEN the cleanup workflow runs AND the gh-pages branch exists THEN the workflow SHALL proceed with normal cleanup operations
3. WHEN the cleanup workflow encounters a Git fetch error THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup workflow to be resilient to Git configuration issues, so that temporary Git problems don't cause permanent workflow failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git fetch fails due to network issues THEN the workflow SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
2. WHEN Git operations fail due to permissions THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages about token configuration
3. WHEN the gh-pages branch is corrupted or inaccessible THEN the workflow SHALL log the issue and continue without failing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup workflow to initialize the gh-pages branch if it doesn't exist, so that future deployments and cleanups work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup workflow runs AND no gh-pages branch exists THEN the workflow SHALL create an empty gh-pages branch
2. WHEN creating the gh-pages branch THEN the workflow SHALL set up proper Git configuration for future operations
3. WHEN the gh-pages branch is created THEN the workflow SHALL create the necessary directory structure for preview deployments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup workflow to validate its environment before attempting operations, so that it fails fast with clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup workflow starts THEN it SHALL verify that required secrets and tokens are available
2. WHEN the cleanup workflow starts THEN it SHALL check if the repository has GitHub Pages enabled
3. WHEN environment validation fails THEN the workflow SHALL provide actionable error messages for fixing the configuration
